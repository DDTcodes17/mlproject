# Student Performance Prediction System

A Modular End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline to predict specific subject scores based on demographic
and academic history, utilizing a Kaggle dataset of student records to model complex feature interactions.

Coded a dynamic model evaluation module that trains a suite of algorithms (including XGBoost, Random Forest, and
Linear Regression), utilizing a custom-built function to automatically compare performance metrics and select the
optimal model.

Hands on Deployment for the final solution on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, operating on the Flask web application to provide an interactive user interface for real-time performance predictions.
